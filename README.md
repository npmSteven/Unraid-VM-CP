# Unraid VM CP (Alpha)
In Alpha

Unraid VM CP is a project that provides additional functionality for [Unraid](https://unraid.net/). The purpose of this project is to allow Unraid users to give access to manage their VMs without requiring the recipient to have their own Unraid login credentials.

## Notice
I work on this project in my spare time, so sometimes I won't be able to update it or fix issues as quickly as I want, but I remain committed to supporting it. If this project has been helpful to you, please consider sponsoring it so that I can continue working on it.

## Stack
- Overall
  - Docker
  - concurrently
  - pnpm
- Frontend
  - Solidjs
  - TypeScript
- Backend
  - Nodejs
  - TypeScript
  - Sequlize (sqlite)
  - express

## Features
- Gives you the ability to grant access and permissions to specific VMs for designated users.
- Able to control a VM without needing to login to [Unraid](https://unraid.net/).

## How does Unraid VM CP work?
The system's architecture is relatively simple, consisting of two primary components: the Frontend and the Backend. While the Frontend is straightforward, the Backend is more complex in comparison.

We call the Unraid API directly, using endpoints that were found by inspecting network requests. These endpoints are not officially supported, so if the API returns unexpected results, the backend may break. To avoid issues, please use caution after Unraid updates and stay informed about this project.

## What happens if Unraid introduces a feature to create a managed user with VM access?
If that feature becomes available and this project no longer addresses any other outstanding issues, then I will consider archiving it. It would be great if Unraid offers such functionality in the future.
